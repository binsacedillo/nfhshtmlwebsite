        <h1 id="mainfont">NORTH FAIRVIEW HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY</h1>
    <aside>
    <p id="mainfont" class="historyy">North Fairview High School is situated in Auburn Street, North Fairview Park Subdivision, Quezon City. It caters to students residing not only around the neighbourhood but also to places as far south as Barangay Commonwealth and up north to Novaliches, District II of Caloocan City and San Jose del Monte, Bulacan.
    <br>
    <br>
    The school opened in 1994 as an annex of Lagro High School (former name was Lagro High School-Fairview Annex) with Mrs.Justina A. Farolan as Head Teacher-In-Charge. The school started with the first year level that was housed in an eight-room storey two storey school building. A year after, a three-room makeshift building was built and added to accommodate more enrolees which included second year students. Seven sections for first and second year students were served.
    <br>
    <br>
    With the active participation and support of the Parents-Teachers Association, school facilities in the form of additional chairs, benches, tables, gate and perimeter fence were provided and built. Other donations such as books and instructional materials were also solicited.
    <br>
    <br>
    When Mrs.Farolan was transferred to another school, Mrs. Rowena A. Cacanindin was tasked to take charge. Under her leadership, new structures such as additional makeshift classrooms, basketball court, fence on either side fronting the main gate, additional chairs and tables, cabinets and other necessary facilities and equipment were acquired. Also, the school canteen, staff and comfort rooms were renovated while the school quadrangle was asphalted.
    <br>
    <br>
    When Mrs.Cacanindin was assigned as principal of Carlos P. Garcia High School, Mrs. Milagros G. Calica took over as Head Teacher In-Charge (HTIC). Mrs.Calica continued what the other HTIC started. She upgraded the existing school facilities like the library, staff room and school canteen until she was appointed Principal of San Jose High School.
    <br>
    <br>
    In 1997, Ms. Betty C. Cavo took over as school administrator. During her administration, physical facilities were given priorities which include the improvement of the school canteen, guidance room, PTA room and computer room. A perimeter fence and additional makeshift rooms and stage were also built. It was also during her stint as administrator that the 12- room 3- storey Mathay Building was built.
    <br>
    <br>
    The years 1999-2004 saw Dr. Cristina L. Doctor as administrator. For 5 years, Dr. Doctor strove to create a school where students were groomed to meet life as they should. Cleanliness, beautification, improvement of school facilities and discipline were the order of the day. A 16-room 4-storey SB Hall was built, a new canteen was put up and a cooperative store was established. A one-storey building was also constructed through the Chinese Business Club which housed the Technology and Home Economics department. It was also under her administration when Lagro High School-Fairview Annex became independent from its mother school, Lagro High School on June 22, 2001 under DECS Order No. 5 s.2001
    <br>
    <br>
    When Dr. Doctor retired, Dr. Josefina M. Pamplina took over in 2005. Dr.Pamplina prioritized the reclassification of positions and promotions of teachers. This resulted to sudden promotion and becoming full-fledged Department Heads of Department Chairmen. She also recommended for promotion four Master Teachers, Teacher III and Teacher II positions.
    <br>
    <br>
    When Dr. Pamplina retired from the service in 2007, Dr.Proceso T. Lera, former principal of Quezon City Science High School was tasked to take charge.Dr. Lera focused on school facilities and development in the performance of both students and teachers. Such include construction of parents’ lounge, audio-visual room, rehabilitation and renovation of Simon building and library.
    <br>
    <br>
    After Dr.Lera’s term, Mrs. Sheridan G. Evangelista assumed post as the new school head. Her initial plan of action is to develop the culture of excellence in terms of personal discipline, courtesy, respect, cleanliness and academic excellence. She believes that the culture of excellence can be internalized with an environment that is safe, clean, healthy and conducive to learning. A true administrator, she strives to create a school where students and teachers are groomed to meet life as they should.
    <br>
    <br>
    At present, the school now has five buildings, two of which are three-storey, one four-storey building, one two-storey building and one-storey building. The three-storey buildings include the Mathay Hall and the DepEd Building. The four-storey building includes the SB Building. The two-storey building includes the Simon Building and the one-storey building houses the PTA office and library. There are 30 academic classrooms, School Library, Computer Room, Registrar Office, Audio-Visual Room, Canteen, Property Office, Administrative Office, Academic Head’s Office and Principal’s Office.
    <br>
    <br>
    To date, the school population for SY 2012-2013 has risen to 5, 347. The teaching staff and faculty are now composed of eight academic heads, 20 master teachers, and 130 classroom teachers. The school is also supported by a regular permanent bookkeeper, disbursing officer, librarian, clerk, 4 utility workers and 4 security enforcers .
    <br>
    <br>
    When Mrs. Sheridan G. Evangelista was promoted and transferred to another school, Mrs. Angelita G. Regis took the lead as the new school principal of North Fairview High School. She assumed the post on October 01, 2014. At the span of six months, she was able to rehabilitate learning centers for some departments for a more conducive environment, renovated the Property Office, improved the water system, rehabilitated the Audio-Visual Room, transferred the TLE laboratory rooms from ground floor to second floor for safety and preservation of the tools and equipment, transferred the clinic, and many more. She also initiated the construction of the Covered Court through linkages to local government units. These will be her legacy as she planned to retire in this school.
    <br>
    <br>
    She wanted also to strengthen the instilled culture and discipline of the students by maintaining theschool as a Child-Friendly School, and the mark of excellence by supporting the students in bringing honorsthrough winning in different contests in the country.
    <br>
    <br>
    Mrs. Regis hoped that students will improve their academic performance and set goals for themselves for them to become productive citizens of this country and she wished that teachers should enhance productivity and commitment in exalting service to the stakeholders.
    <br>
    <br>
    For the coming years, she will lead North Fairview High School to the road of success by her own proven and tested technique leading the school in a child-friendly and blissful way.</p>
